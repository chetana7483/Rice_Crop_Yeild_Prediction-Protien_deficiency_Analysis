Rice Crop Yield Prediction and Protein Deficiency Analysis

Overview
This project utilizes Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and machine learning techniques to analyze rice crop yield, soil conditions, and protein deficiency severity. It processes agricultural data, visualizes key insights, and employs predictive models to estimate crop yield and nutrient deficiencies. Additionally, it provides recommendations to improve rice production and address protein deficiencies.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans, structures, and converts data for accurate analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses statistical and graphical techniques to understand yield patterns and soil characteristics.
Machine Learning Models: Implements Random Forest for predicting yield, protein deficiency severity, and optimal rice variety.
Visualization Tools: Includes bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to illustrate key factors affecting yield.
User Input & Prediction: Allows users to input environmental conditions and receive crop yield predictions.
Recommendation System: Suggests fertilizers, soil management techniques, and suitable rice varieties for improved yield and reduced deficiency.
